## Description

_The idea here is to let users compile a simple to do list for their own personal lives. Users will enter through an input and that list will append it onto the page. Once it is appended through the backend there will be a logic that will let you cross off the to do items based on completion of the user._

* _Access the repository of to do list_
* _Copy clone link_
* _Access local repository and which directory you want to clone from_

_You do not need to run a server to run this application. No databases need to be set. This is a single repository that you need to access and you do not need any other application to run the webpage._
